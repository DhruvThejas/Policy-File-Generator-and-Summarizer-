AUTO INSURANCE POLICY

COVERAGE A - LIABILITY COVERAGE
We will pay damages for bodily injury or property damage for which any insured becomes legally responsible because of an auto accident. Damages include prejudgment interest awarded against the insured. We will settle or defend, as we consider appropriate, any claim or suit asking for these damages. Our duty to settle or defend ends when our limit of liability for this coverage has been exhausted.

COVERAGE B - MEDICAL PAYMENTS
We will pay reasonable expenses incurred for necessary medical and funeral services because of bodily injury:
1. Caused by accident; and
2. Sustained by an insured.
We will pay only those expenses incurred within 3 years from the date of the accident.

COVERAGE C - UNINSURED MOTORIST
We will pay compensatory damages which an insured is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury:
1. Sustained by an insured; and
2. Caused by an accident.
The owner's or operator's liability for these damages must arise out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the uninsured motor vehicle.

COVERAGE D - COLLISION
We will pay for direct and accidental loss to your covered auto or any non-owned auto, including their equipment, minus any applicable deductible shown in the Declarations. We will pay for loss to your covered auto caused by:
1. Collision with another object; or
2. Upset of your covered auto.
