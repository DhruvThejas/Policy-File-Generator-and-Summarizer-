## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git (optional)

## Setup Steps

1. Extract the ZIP file to a folder (e.g., 'policy_explainer')

2. Open Command Prompt/Terminal and run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to project folder
cd path/to/policy_explainer

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# For Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# For Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install streamlit
pip install ctransformers
pip install huggingface-hub
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run policy_explainer.py
```

## Using the Application
- The app will open in your default web browser

- Input methods:
  - Paste text directly
  - Upload text/PDF files

- Download results as text files

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure Python 3.11+ is installed
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Check internet connection (required for first run)
- Ensure 8GB+ RAM available
- First run will take longer (model download ~4GB)

## Notes
